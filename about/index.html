	<h1>Hi There</h1>
	<p>I'm a current student at the Institute for Advanced Analytics working on all things <u>statistics</u>, <u>computer science</u>, and <u>machine learning</u>  </p>
	<p>When I'm not in class, I love spending quality time with friends and family throughout the country, traveling internationally when I can find a deal, and dedicating shower thoughts to side projects. Check out the home page for my most recent work helping NC residents make better scratch-off ticket purchases</p>
