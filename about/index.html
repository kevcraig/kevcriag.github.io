	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I am a current student at the <a href = "https://analytics.ncsu.edu/" target = "_blank"> Institute for Advanced Analytics </a> working on all things <u>statistics</u>, <u>math</u>, and <u>machine learning</u>.  </p>
	<p>When not in class, I love spending quality time with friends and family throughout the country, traveling internationally when I can find a deal (on pause at the moment), and dedicating shower thoughts to side projects. Check out <a href = "/ScratcherStatsNC" target = "_blank"> my most recent work </a> helping NC residents make better scratch-off ticket purchases.</p>
