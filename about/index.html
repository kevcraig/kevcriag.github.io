	<h1>Hi There</h1>
	<p>I'm a current student at the Institute for Advanced Analytics working on all things statistics, computer science, and machine learning.  </p>
	<p>When I'm not in class, I love spending quality time with friends and family throughout the country, traveling internationally when I can find a deal, and dedicating shower thoughts to side projects. Check out the home page for my most recent work helping NC residents make better scratch-off ticket purchases. For a more comprehensive list of the things I like to talk about:</p>
